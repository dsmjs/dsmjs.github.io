A style guide or component-library has the potential to be huge help in keeping
your engineering teams up to date on the latest intended design details. Over
time however, it ultimately severely diverges from the production implementation
and ends up resulting in finger-pointing between the design and engineering
organizations.

Sharing the implementation of the front-end components between the production
application and the component-library demo and prototype(s) prevents the inevitable
divergence and keeps all parties aware of the impacts of desired changes. This talk
will highlight component-library tools and collaboration techniques, with an emphasis
on leveraging npm to share the component implementation.
