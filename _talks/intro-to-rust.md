We’re keeping our virtual events going with the help of [DSM Web Geeks](https://www.dsmwebgeeks.com/). This event again will be virtual. So yay! Everyone is welcome. Join us as we learn the basics of the Rust programming language and get some hands-on experience with a it.

We’re going to talk about the Rust programming language. Specifically, it’s history, how it’s different from other languages, syntax and features, and how to get started programming with Rust today.
