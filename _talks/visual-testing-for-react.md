Join us July 13th on Zoom for a presentation on visual testing for React components with the VP of Engineering at Cypress.io.

### About the talk

Many modern web frameworks use components as their building blocks.In this talk, I will show component testing using Cypress – and I mean “show” literally. You will see the component running inside a real browser, you will interact with the component like a real user, and you can debug the component using the real browser’s DevTools. Finally, I will go through the current open source and commercial options for visually testing the component’s styles and rendering.
