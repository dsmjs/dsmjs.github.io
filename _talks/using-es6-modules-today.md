Do you want to use the next generation of javascript modules today? Join me for a live coding session where I show how to write es6 modules and transpile them to AMD. Specifically I'll be showing off the es6-module-transpiler. If we have time I'll also show a bower demo where you can install and import modules on demand without having to worry about order dependent scripts (even for scripts with nested dependencies).
