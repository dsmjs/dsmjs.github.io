AngularFire is a lightweight resource the blends the two worlds of Angular and Firebase together. Extending the simplistic 2-way data-binding of Angular to be connected to a RESTful API allows for the coveted “3-way data-binding!” I will be showing examples of this 3-way data-binding and, more importantly, how easy it is to set up and bring your site to the next level. You can also set up authentication very easily using built-in plugins for Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus sign-on.
