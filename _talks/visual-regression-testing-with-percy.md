Automated visual testing can be hard to justify because it is difficult and
expensive to do well while focusing on a relatively low-risk the part of the
system. As a pragmatic engineer, visual testing is typically low on my
priority list, compared to other layers of automated testing. However,
[Percy](https://percy.io/) lowers the effort and improves the signal-to-noise
ratio enough that I have found it to be a valuable part of my approach. This
lightning talk will share my experience with integrating cheaply and getting
high value from this tool.
