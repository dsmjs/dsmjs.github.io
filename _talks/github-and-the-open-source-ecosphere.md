If you've been attending user group meetings, or just had someone forward you a GitHub URL - you've seen some of the things that developers have been doing in the Open Source community. In this session, I'll talk about open source development, the GitHub ecosphere and how you can get involved. Along the way, we'll share some success stories (and not so successful stories) about getting involved in the community, how you can make positive contributions and what to expect when you start your own open source project.
