Michael and his team bravely broke from the tradition of Protractor for Angular end-to-end testing and forged a new path in their local community by using Cypress. Was the grass greener? Yes, it was. This talk will cover at a high level what Cypress is, what it offers and who is likely to use it. Then we'll dive into built-in features that make Cypress so awesome to use. Michael will also discuss common challenges faced when creating and implementing an end-to-end test suite. This includes test structuring, dealing with authentication, timing issues and more.
