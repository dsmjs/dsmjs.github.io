This will be a great event to get engaged with your community. Join us January 10th at 6:30pm for a group discussion on user group planning and organizing. We would love your feedback on what is working, what is not working, and how we can do better.

Weâ€™ll start off with talking about all the incredible events and things our members did last year. Then we can talk about new things we would like to do in 2022. Hope to see you there.
