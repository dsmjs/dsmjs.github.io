Join us Monday February 8th at 6:30pm as we dig in to React hooks. This will be a hands on Dojo. If you’re new to React, or just haven’t tried hooks yet, this event will be perfect for you. We’ll cover React’s basic hooks, custom hooks, and writing tests.

## About this Event

We will be walking through example code using [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/) so your environment should be all set up and ready to be productive in. You may want to spend a minute or two getting yourself familiar with [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/).
