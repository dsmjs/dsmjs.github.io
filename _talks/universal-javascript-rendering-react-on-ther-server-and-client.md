Is your SPA was easily indexable, [Fast](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-on-twittercom), maintainable?  I will show how to server side render any initial request into a SPA with [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), and then client side render any following requests.  Write your views in React once and don't worry where they render.
