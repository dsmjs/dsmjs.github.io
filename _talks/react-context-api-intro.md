React’s Context API with other React Hooks has become the state management tool
of choice for many. It can replace Redux altogether and is a solution to prop
drilling. In this talk, you’ll see an introduction to what Context is and how
to use it!

Code examples and resources available on [github repo](https://github.com/micleners/context-dsmjs).
