Join us Tuesday, July 13th at 6:30pm (CST) a panel discussion from folks involved in the local youth engagement organization, Tech Journey. Tech Journey helps youth in the area increase their knowledge and interest in technology by providing engaging learning opportunities with tech professionals like you! You've probably heard of them before - or even volunteered at an event like a Coder Dojo or their Tech Camp! The panel at this event will include individuals responsible for organizing events, facilitation workshops, and getting students in the seat. Come hear about how they got involved in Tech Journey, the impact Tech Journey has on the community, and how you can get involved, too.

This event will hosted at We Write Code. That's right - our first event back in person this year and **with pizza!** We will also offer a remote option via zoom. **RSVP** and we will **send you deets on the location and zoom meeting room link**. Please spread the word and we will plan to see you there!
