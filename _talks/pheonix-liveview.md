Phoenix LiveView provides the real-time user experience we’ve come to expect on the web but with the simplicity of a server side programming model. Along with the Elixir programming language, ecosystem and Erlang Virtual Machine you will find Phoenix LiveView was designed for building scalable web applications that set the bar for developer productivity. At our next evening event, Toran Billups will guide us through a hands-on Phoenix LiveView workshop. This introduction to the LiveView programming model will involve building a frontend for the popular card game “President”.

Feel free to bring a laptop so you can participate! Get a head start by installing Docker (especially if you have a Windows machine) and cloning the [workshop repo](https://github.com/toranb/liveview-workshop).
