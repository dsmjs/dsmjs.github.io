Ever inherit an app only to spend hours or days trying to get it to run locally? Tried running apps locally on one OS when production servers use a different OS? Tried something new and completely messed up your workstation? Wondered if there’s a better way? Vagrant is a tool for solving these challenges. It relies on virtualization and automation tools to quickly spin up local development environments. Easily blow away and recreate environments after screwing them up. Generally make life easier for devs working with the app, allow them to focus on adding new features, and not wasting time getting their local environment setup.
