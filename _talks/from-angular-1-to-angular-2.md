AngularJS is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks available for creating web applications. The switch from Angular 1 and adoption of Angular 2 has been a source of anxiety for members of the enterprise. That concern is what we seek to alleviate in this talk.

Keyhole Principal Consultant Jaime Niswonger will present a live demonstration of Angular 2 in action.

Jaime will build an example Angular 2 application applicable to enterprise use. He will point out unique features and approaches the Angular 2 framework introduces, with an eye for potential pitfalls. The presentation will show how it contrasts from Angular 1 and other comparable JavaScript frameworks, in addition to a contrast from existing development patterns and techniques.

The presentation will be followed with a Q&A session.
