Advances in JavaScript cryptography have resulted in several libraries made available that can perform client side encryption.  We’ll look at two of the most common, SJCL and CryptoJS, along with the WebCrypto API that the W3C is currently drafting.  Finally, we’ll look at the practical applications and pitfalls of using client side encryption and discuss real world use cases.
