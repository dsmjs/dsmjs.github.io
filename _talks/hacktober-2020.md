Let’s get hacking! Join us October 12th, at 6:30pm on Zoom. We’ll start off with a quick demo on making open source contributions. This is a good chance to practice contribution flow and pairing with others.

After the demo we’ll have time to share contributions that you’ve made, or have been working on. If you have a project you would like support on, or know of an open source project that could use support let us know about it. Share your projects with @dsmwebgeeks, @desmoinesjs or tell us about it during the event.
