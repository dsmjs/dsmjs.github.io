Join us Tuesday, May 12th at 6pm (CST) for our *first ever virtual meetup combining both Des Moines Web Geeks and dsmJS members!* This unique social outlet will bring us closer than ever before over a variety of topics like:
- Discussing our shared experience with this current COVID-19 crisis
- Provide an opportunity for community members who want a social outlet
- Discuss with others what it's like to be entering the field or looking for a job in this environment
- Work-life balance (FYI - kids and pets welcome!)

Access to a Trello board will be provided for us all to post questions or topics for the group throughout the meeting. It'll be much like a "parking-lot" Kanban board approach to topics! If you have questions now, tell us your question via this google form. Along the way, feel free to add any follow-up questions by leaving a comment on the topic's Trello board or in the chat. All are welcome and encouraged to attend this free event.

This is a great way to stay "meet" other like-minded community individuals and have a little human interaction during these times of isolation.

**RSVP** and we will **send you a meeting room link** the day of the event. Please spread the word and we will plan to see you there!
