You won't want to miss this interactive demo in which Todd Brunia will build,
deploy and test a NodeJS Lambda solution in the Amazon Web Services cloud.
From scratch, Todd will demonstrate how to code and unit test a basic Lambda
function. He will also show how to deploy a Lambda to the AWS cloud using
continuous delivery through Jenkins. If time allows, Todd will also demonstrate

backend system for your next UI project!
