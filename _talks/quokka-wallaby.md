[Giveaway Results](https://youtu.be/yb4kCEEcdKE)

I’ll be giving a live demonstration of the fantastic [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/), an in editor  prototyping tool. I’ll also be demonstrating the powerful [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com), a tool that allows for immediate testing feedback, right in your editor of choice.

We will also be giving  away a 1 year bundle license for Quokka + Wallaby, a $150 value! Thanks so much to the gracious Wallaby team for supporting dsmJS!
