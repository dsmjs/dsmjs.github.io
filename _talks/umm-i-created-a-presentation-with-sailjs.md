Sailsjs is great for creating awesome backend applications. Its very quick to stand up an endpoint and fly forward. However, what if you wanted to use it as your presentation platform (like Revealjs)? This talk is focused around the flexibility that Sailjs provides it’s users.

Fueled by silliness and coffee Chuck tries to create efficiency in everything he and others do. His specialties are Front-end development, architecture, continuous integration, and bringing much needed innovation to enterprises. He absolutely love technology, and spends a vast majority of his time learning about it or teaching it.
