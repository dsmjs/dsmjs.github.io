At the last meeting there were some questions on the subject and this is a subject I have done some work and research in. I would like to do an overview of the different OAuth flows and how they work. Will probably do it with live coding. React for the front end flows and Node for the back end flows. Kind of expand on the public api talk from last week. Showing how you would implement three legged oauth, so if you wanted to build a client app on top of say Spotify and have your users login you can do so. I don't have all details yet, as the idea recently came to me.
