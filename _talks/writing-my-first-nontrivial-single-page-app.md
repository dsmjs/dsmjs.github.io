Anyone can hype their favorite javascript framework but what happens when you need to build something bigger than a todo app? I decided to find out for myself a few months back when I started writing my first ambitious javascript application.

During this talk I'll cover

* What is so great about the url?
* So what happens when I click refresh?
* Prevent data loss when the user clicks the back button
* Do you need objects with rich relationships?
* How to bootstrap your application at runtime
* Sharing state between views/routes
* What about catastrophic javascript errors?
* What does $.ajax error handling look like?
* Where do you handle application wide navigation?
* How does jQuery fit into the picture today?
* What build tool did I use and how did I deploy with it?
* When did I find unit tests helpful? When integration tests?
* Transactions -do we need them on the client?
