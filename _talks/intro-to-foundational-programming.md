If you are new to programming, join us March 8th as we build a tic-tac-toe game in VueJS. Our focus will be on establishing solid foundations in your programming skills to build applications quickly.

This workshop will take about 60 minutes over Zoom. We will have extra time for help if needed as we work through the material. All of our work will be done in Codepen, so as long as you have a browser you can follow along.
