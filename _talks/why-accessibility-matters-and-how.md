Fun story! My team has recently diverted almost all development effort towards accessibility due to external audits. Apparently big brother is watching!

Understanding the scope of the accessibility and getting our team up to speed has been quite the effort. I want to help you reap the benefit of our mishaps by sharing what went wrong and what we learned.

The topic is broad, so come ready to learn and share your own stories around accessibility. Hopefully we can help other teams out there can do to avoid getting in hot water like we have.
