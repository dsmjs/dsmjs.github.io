It’s the end of a long year, and we would like to see all the incredible projects you’ve been working on.
Join us on December 13th and share your projects with the community.

Rather you’ve been building a front-end web application or learning to play the lute.
Show and share your cool projects with DSM Web Geeks and dsmJS.

Let us know if you have a fun project or cool talent you would like to share during the event by [signing up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdZDFRUaBEkm3oTIuItLWPdd2txfZLmye9PcYF-uoX12T-uA/viewform).
