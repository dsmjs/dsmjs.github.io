On large teams we spend a great deal of time providing accurate and concise instructions to reproduce a problem when QA finds an issue. What if instead we could export the state of the application and attach it as an artifact for the developer for further debugging and verification?

In this talk I'll discover a bug and show a QA/Dev workflow that I believe is the future of QA and Dev collaboration.
