Browser Apps/Extensions can be super helpful for day to day use. Making a Chrome App or Extension actually isn't as hard as it might seem. However, there are some differences between a Chrome App and Extension that might make a difference between which one you go with. I’ll go over creating a basic one, some of the standard API items, and some of the tips/tricks I learned while making one of each. Hopefully by the end of this you could go home and create your own App/Extension.
