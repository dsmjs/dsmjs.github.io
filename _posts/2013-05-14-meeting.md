### Intro Topic * Writing JavaScript like a grown-up

Are you producing write-once / read-never javascript? Do you want to
develop something you can reason about but just don't know where to start?
Join us for a 30 minute beginner friendly discussion about how I was writing
javascript a year ago and what I did to improve the quality of my client side
code!

[Toran Billups](http://toranbillups.com) is a python and javascript
enthusiast with hopes of knowing enough about ember.js and django to build a
modern web app

### Advanced Topic * JavaScript Game Development (intermediate ImpactJS)

Joel will be giving a Part II version of his [DSM Webgeeks lunch presentation](http://www.dsmwebgeeks.com/2013/04/javascript-game-development-%E2%80%93-lunch-meeting-wed-april-17th/)
(April 17th) on Javascript Game Development and will build on some of the basic
concepts he demonstrated.  He will be modeling much of the talk after the Introducing
HTML5 Game Development book by Jesse Freeman and will introduce concepts such as: 

- Gravity / Friction
- Collision Objects
- Player vs. Enemy entities

If there is time and interest he will also demonstrate how to package an ImpactJS
game to run native on an iOS device - while not writing ANY Objective-C.
